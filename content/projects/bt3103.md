### **About**
In recent years, rising living costs and food inflation have made grocery shopping increasingly stressful for many Singaporeans. Global economic disruptions have affected local pricing, making transparency more essential than ever. **The Fair Tracker** was built to address this challenge—a centralized, user-friendly platform that empowers consumers to compare prices across major supermarket chains (NTUC, Sheng Siong, etc.) to make smarter, cost-effective decisions.

Our platform serves a diverse audience, from budget-conscious students to families and seniors. By creating an account, users unlock personalized tools to track spending, monitor price drops, and manage grocery lists dynamically.

### **Agile Development Methodology**
This project was executed using the **SCRUM methodology** over two intensive 2-week sprints.
* **Process:** Guided by a refined product backlog, we successfully implemented **24 core user stories**.
* **Collaboration:** We maintained rigorous Agile practices including Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, and Retrospectives.
* **Tools:** Progress was tracked via **Google Sheets** and **GitHub Projects**, with UI/UX prototyping conducted in **Figma**.

## **Key Features**
* **🔍 Centralized Price Comparison:** Instantly compare product prices across multiple major supermarket chains.
* **📈 Historical Price Trends:** Interactive line charts (powered by VueChartkick) to visualize price fluctuations over time.
* **📍 Store Locator:** Integrated **Google Maps API** to help users find the nearest supermarket with the best deals.
* **📝 Smart Grocery List:** Create, organize, and manage shopping lists directly within the app.
* **⭐ Watchlist & Alerts:** Bookmark favorite items and receive alerts when prices drop.
* **💬 Community Reviews:** Read and write product reviews to help the community make better choices.

### **Technologies Stack**
* **Frontend Framework:** Vue.js, Vuetify
* **Backend & Database:** Firebase (Authentication & Firestore)
* **Visualization:** VueChartkick
* **APIs:** Google Maps Platform
* **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

> **Disclaimer:** This project was developed as part of the **BT3103 Application Systems Development for Business Analytics** coursework. Prices displayed in the application are simulated for educational purposes due to API limitations.
