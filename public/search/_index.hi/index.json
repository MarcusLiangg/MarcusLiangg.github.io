This project focuses on Lending Club\u0026rsquo;s dataset available online, one of the world\u0026rsquo;s largest Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platforms, to address the critical challenge of credit default prediction. Using a dataset spanning 2007 to 2020, our team aimed to identify high-risk borrowers and forecast the likelihood of loan default, enabling the firm to minimize financial losses while maximizing profitable lending opportunities.\nThe core of this project involved building an end-to-end Big Data machine learning pipeline. We processed a massive dataset (1.7 GB) containing millions of loan records, tackling real-world challenges such as high dimensionality and severe class imbalance (where defaults represented only ~13% of data). By leveraging advanced resampling techniques and distributed computing, we developed a robust model capable of flagging potential defaulters with high recall.\nOur analysis revealed that factors such as hardship reasons, loan grades, and home ownership status (specifically renters) were the strongest predictors of default. The final model offers a data-driven approach for Lending Club to refine its risk-pricing strategies, such as tightening criteria for lower-grade loans or offering competitive rates to stable borrower profiles.\nMethodology Big Data Processing: Utilized PySpark to handle data cleaning and preprocessing for over 2.9 million rows, including handling missing values and standardizing inconsistent formats. Feature Engineering \u0026amp; Selection: Created custom risk indicators like credit_util_ratio and installment_to_income_ratio. Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce 83 features down to 62, capturing 95% of the variance while reducing computational load. Handling Imbalance: Implemented hybrid resampling strategies, specifically SMOTE + ENN (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique combined with Edited Nearest Neighbours), to improve the model\u0026rsquo;s ability to detect the minority \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; class. Predictive Modeling: Trained and evaluated six different classifiers including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBT). Optimization: The Random Forest model was selected as the best performer, achieving a Recall of 0.82, ensuring that the vast majority of potential defaulters are correctly identified.

Global economic disruptions have affected local pricing, making transparency more essential than ever. The Fair Tracker was built to address this challenge—a centralized, user-friendly platform that empowers consumers to compare prices across major supermarket chains (NTUC, Sheng Siong, etc.) to make smarter, cost-effective decisions.\nOur platform serves a diverse audience, from budget-conscious students to families and seniors. By creating an account, users unlock personalized tools to track spending, monitor price drops, and manage grocery lists dynamically.\nAgile Development Methodology This project was executed using the SCRUM methodology over two intensive 2-week sprints.\nProcess: Guided by a refined product backlog, we successfully implemented 24 core user stories. Collaboration: We maintained rigorous Agile practices including Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, and Retrospectives. Tools: Progress was tracked via Google Sheets and GitHub Projects, with UI/UX prototyping conducted in Figma. Key Features 🔍 Centralized Price Comparison: Instantly compare product prices across multiple major supermarket chains. 📈 Historical Price Trends: Interactive line charts (powered by VueChartkick) to visualize price fluctuations over time. 📍 Store Locator: Integrated Google Maps API to help users find the nearest supermarket with the best deals. 📝 Smart Grocery List: Create, organize, and manage shopping lists directly within the app. ⭐ Watchlist \u0026amp; Alerts: Bookmark favorite items and receive alerts when prices drop. 💬 Community Reviews: Read and write product reviews to help the community make better choices.

Charity DAO solves this by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure that every donation is traceable, immutable, and used for its intended purpose.\nThis project implements a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) where donors receive Governance Tokens (GOV) in exchange for ETH contributions. Unlike traditional charities, funds are not released in a lump sum. Instead, we utilized a milestone-based disbursement system where NGOs must submit proof of work (uploaded to IPFS) which must be verified before the next tranche of funding is unlocked.\nGovernance \u0026amp; Architecture Quadratic Voting: To prevent \u0026ldquo;whales\u0026rdquo; (wealthy donors) from dominating decision-making, we implemented a quadratic voting model where the cost of votes scales exponentially, giving smaller donors more proportional influence. Reputation System: Consistent participation is incentivized through a tiered reputation system that offers voting cost discounts to active, long-term donors. Smart Contract Modules: Treasury: Manages ETH holdings and mints tokens. VotingManager: Handles the logic for quadratic voting and reputation calculations. ProofOracle: Verifies off-chain proofs (uploaded to Pinata) to trigger on-chain fund release.
